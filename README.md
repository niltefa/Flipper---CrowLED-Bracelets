# Flipper CrowdLED Wristbands Controller (Concert Bracelets)
This repository contains files for controlling CrewdLED concert bracelets using sub-GHz (433.92MHz) frequency, designed for use with the Flipper Zero. These files are intended for experimentation and educational purposes. Each file corresponds to a specific action, such as setting the color to red, creating gradient effects, or displaying multicolor patterns. They are capable of synchronizing concert wristbands to produce a coordinated light show.

> **Kindly abstain from employing this code to disturb events or intrude upon individuals engagements. Show regard for event coordinators, entertainers, and attendees. The primary aim here is educational, tailored for experimentation under controlled circumstances.**

## Preparation
CrewdLED concert bracelets are divided into three groups, each independently controllable. In this repository, files are tailored for group 3 bracelets. While some files might work with other groups, thorough testing has not been conducted. To determine your group, check the large number on the back of your bracelet:

## Credits
The analysis, extraction and acquisition of the .sub fragments allowing these actions (colour, effects...) were made possible thanks to the use of the 30-minute .sub file recorded by [MakeTotalSense](https://github.com/MakeTotalSense) during a concert:
